Phyiscs 
======
With an eagerness to unravel the mystery of the Universe I joined St Stephen's College to pursue my undergraduate in Physics. I met wonderful people, undertook daunting projects, participated in the Electronics society all the while keeping my love of coding alive. In the very first semester I was intorduced to the world of computational physics which helped me turn my *equations into code*. Easier said than done. By the time I was in third year I became fascinated with the world of AI which was striding at a rapid pace fueled by the GPU revolution. Armed with the mathmeatical prowess I developed studying physics, I turned my attention towards understanding AI

Machine Learning
======
I stepped into the world of machine learning after graduating with a degree in physics starting with a course titled [Machine Learning for Physicists](https://machine-learning-for-physicists.org/). Hungry for more, I undertook a guided project to get a practical understanding of the neural networks. As a geospatial analyst at Pixxel my knowledge in multiple domains proved useful.

University College London
======
I joined the MSc programme at University College London in September 2023 specialising in machine learning determined to unravel the mathematics behind the *AI boom*. And the course did not disappoint. Here I got interested into 3D modelling and AR/VR  which is which became a guiding factor in deciding disseration topic in 4 dimensional gaussian splattting. 


The road ahead
=======
Seeing my passion for machine vision, I am actively pursuing opportunities in the fields of machine vision, 3D modeling, and AR/VR. I know encompass a wide range of industries and at the nascent stages of my career I am open to everything 	&#128516;
