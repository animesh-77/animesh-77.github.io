Hello!! &#x1F44B; I am a recent graduate from University College London, where I specialized in machine learning. I hold an undergraduate degree in Physics and have worked on projects ranging from satellite mission planning to deep learning and AR/VR. My most recent work, my master's dissertation, focused on 3D Gaussian splatting for the fashion industry. I am now actively seeking opportunities to work on engaging Machine Learning problems. &#128516;
