Hello!! &#x1F44B; I am a masters student at University College London specialising in machine learning. I hold an undergraduate degree in physics and have worked on projects ranging from satellite mission planning to deep learning and AR/VR. Computer vision has been a longstanding interest of mine, and I am currently focused on my dissertation project on gaussian splatting as part of my masters degree.	

I am actively looking for opportunities in computer vision and AR/VR &#128516;
