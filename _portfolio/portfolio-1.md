# Overview

For my MSc dissertation in Machine Learning at UCL, I investigated the limits of current 3D Gaussian Splatting when extended to ultra high resolution training images to model high frequency features relating to human subjects.

High-resolution novel view synthesis of human subjects is highly valuable in the fashion industry, offering consumers an immersive way to engage with their favorite clothing brands.
